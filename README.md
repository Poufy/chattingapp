# chattingapp
A small demo on the use of socket io and express to make a simple chatting app

to run it simply type the following commands in the terminal.


git clone https://github.com/Poufy/chattingapp.git


npm install --save express


npm install --save socket.io


node index.js


and open your browser on http://localhost:3000/


#TODO
Instead of using the map for the user names just send the username to the server and emit it to all the other clients and handle the printing there.
